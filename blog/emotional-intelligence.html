          <h1><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) is having the ability to understand,
            use, and manage your own emotions in ways to positively relieve
            stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome
            challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you
            build stronger relationships, succeed in the working and schooling
            environment, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also
            help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action,
            and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.
          </p>
          <h1><strong>How is EQ different to IQ</strong></h1>
          <p>
            EQ & IQ represent different aspects of human abilities. IQ primarily
            measures cognitive intelligence, focusing on analytical and
            problem-solving skills. It assesses logical reasoning, memory,
            mathematical abilities, and linguistic proficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, EQ emphasizes emotional awareness, understanding,
            and management. It involves recognizing and navigating emotions in
            oneself and others, as well as handling social interactions
            effectively. EQ encompasses skills like empathy, interpersonal
            communication, and resilience. In essence, IQ measures cognitive
            capabilities, while EQ assesses emotional and social skills. Both
            are valuable, and a balanced combination often contributes to a
            person's overall success and well-rounded capabilities.
          </p>
          <h1><strong>Why is EQ important?</strong></h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Effective Interpersonal Relationships -</strong> EQ enables
            individuals to understand and manage their emotions, as well as
            comprehend and respond to the emotions of others. This skill is
            crucial for building and maintaining positive relationships in
            personal and professional settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Effective Communication -</strong> People with high EQ can
            communicate more effectively, expressing themselves clearly and
            empathizing with others. This is essential for resolving conflicts,
            collaborating with others, and fostering a positive and supportive
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Conflict Resolution - </strong>EQ helps individuals navigate
            conflicts by understanding the emotions involved and finding
            constructive solutions. It promotes a more diplomatic and
            cooperative approach to resolving disputes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Leadership and Teamwork - </strong>Effective leaders often
            possess high levels of emotional intelligence, allowing them to
            inspire and motivate others. EQ is also vital in teamwork, as it
            fosters collaboration, understanding, and a positive team dynamic.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Adaptability and Resilience - </strong>Individuals with high
            EQ can better cope with stress, adapt to change, and bounce back
            from setbacks. This emotional resilience is valuable in both
            personal and professional challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Decision-Making - </strong>Emotional intelligence
            contributes to sound decision-making by incorporating emotional
            awareness into the process. It helps individuals consider the impact
            of decisions on themselves and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Well-being - </strong>EQ plays a significant role
            in individual well-being. People with high emotional intelligence
            tend to have better mental health, as they can navigate their own
            emotions and cope with life's challenges more effectively.
