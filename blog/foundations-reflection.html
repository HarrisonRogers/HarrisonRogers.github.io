          <p>
            A few things I learnt about myself is that I am a good individual
            learner and have an open mindset. Throughout primary school and
            highschool I had learnt about having an open mindset and
            implementing it into my daily life. This has helped me with stress
            and anxiety, I am also able to see the positive on a situation if I
            am stuck on a problem or something personal has gone wrong.

          </h1>
          <p>
            The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in terms of learning
            and programming is how you outlook programming. If you value your
            friends and family and want to see them make time for it and adjust
            your learning and programming around your values and morales. Being
            self-aware will make you understand that a particular problem may be
            to hard and you need to take back and re-think or ask for help.
            These all help you to stay true to yourself.

          <p>
            Just learning about myself and how much being open and true to
            myself can improve my personal health. By being open and wanting to
            learn makes learning more enjoyable and applicable, where I am able
            to put my learning into practice quicker and at a faster pace.

            Me wanting to get into tech and learn about code. I like doing the
            core work and I see the importance of it but I just want to get into
            coding and making programs that function on a screen. Just my
            personal preference.

              >Why do I think we, a programming school, are spending so much

          </h1>
          <p>
            Because getting a job in the tech industry isn't about who can write
            the best code, although that is an added bonus, having good people
            skills is the most important. Being able to communicate with others
            and yourself is something employers look for when hiring.

            <strong
              >Does the time I spend studying core learning here feel like a
              waste of time? Should I have just used that time to practice
              programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong

          </h1>
          <p>
            I don't feel like it is a waste of time. However, I am fresh out of
            highschool and have been learning about personal wellbeing and
            social wellbeing throughout the past 6 years so I am getting a
            little bit sick of it. As I said earlier I just want to get into the
            tech and code and see my learning into practice. But, if I was older
            and hadn't been taught about an open mindset, neuroplasticity and
            emotional-intelligence then I would certainly be interested in
            earning it.
