            <strong>A situation where I made an ethical decision. </strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            When I was playing rugby I went on holiday overseas during the
            school holidays, the team had training through the holidays and I
            wasn’t able to attend any practices. I arrived back from holiday on
            a Friday and we had a game on the Saturday despite not being at
            training. I was still named to the starting team. I thought it was
            quite unfair since there was another strong player in my position
            who had attended all the training throughout the holidays so he
            deserved that spot more than I did. I told the coach that he should
            start since I won’t be as fit and it is unfair on him and to the
            team as well. In the end, another player started over me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe this came from the values I have of fairness and caring.
            It was only fair that he started over me since he had been doing the
            mahi I hadn’t been, and it was my job to get that position back. I
            positively reflect on the outcome of that decision because not only
            was I living up to my values but I was also able to give myself
            competition and a drive to succeed to secure my spot back in the
            starting team.
          </p>

              my values and identity.</strong
            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            The people who influence me are the people I am closest to, like my
            family. Throughout my parents and brothers' life, it has been full
            of success. Success in the sporting and business world. I have grown
            up with a lot of people around me working hard to achieve their
            goals and mostly succeeding them through the hard work that they put
            in. I have learnt many things from the people around me which has
            certainly shaped my values and identity for the better by making me
            a harder worker, having a desire to win, having fairness and being
            disciplined.

            After taking the VIA character quiz it defined my top 5 strengths
            as…
            <br />
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Self Regulation - Regulating what one feels and does; being
              disciplined; controlling one's appetites and emotions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hope - Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it;
              believing that a good future is something that can be brought
              about.
            </li>
            <li>
              Humility - Letting one's accomplishments speak for themselves; not
              regarding oneself as more special than one is.
            </li>
            <li>
              Honesty - Speaking the truth but more broadly genuinely presenting
              oneself and acting sincerely; being without pretense; taking
              responsibility for one's feelings and actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Humour - Liking to laugh and tease; bringing smiles to other
              people; seeing the light side; making (not necessarily telling)
              jokes.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            My top strength of self-regulation I believe will help me a lot
            since I do feel like I am a very disciplined person and am quite
            good at controlling my emotions especially if I am in a stressful
            situation. During Highschool I was never stressed about any school
            work and the deadlines ahead which made me calm and able to have
            quite a calm ride through school. I also feel like the hope strength
            will benefit me greatly because I am excited for my future and to be
            able to achieve what I want in my future I must work for it which
            gives me more motivation and drive with Dev Academy to help me
            achieve my goals.
          </p>
          <h1>
            <strong
              >My limitations in terms of my learning and career development.
              How might these affect my learning journey?</strong
            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            My limitations might be my inexperience in a working environment. I
            have only just graduated high school and I’m pretty sure I’m the
            youngest in the course so the long hours of working and having to
            stay motivated will be a new experience for me because I’m only used
            to the 6-hour school timeline. But I’m hoping my youthfulness can
            give me the energy and motivation to adapt to the new normal.
          </p>

              >An example of when I was trying to work productively with others,
              but there was resistance or tension.</strong
            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            Playing rugby there is a lot of adrenaline which for some people can
            make their temper have a short fuse even for their teammates. When
            playing a game against a high-level team it was difficult enough as
            it was since we were getting beaten by a big private school when two
            of our teammates had a miscommunication and started blaming each
            other. It got very heated and a conflict was caused that needed to
            be contained. My teammates and I took one of the players each and
            tried to calm them down and explain that there are bigger and worse
            things that he should be worrying about than a silly
            miscommunication. It calmed him down and they hugged it out and
            continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strategy of calming down and explaining the problem helped them
            evaluate the situation and come to the realisation that the conflict
            was pretty pointless and to move on and continue. I wouldn’t try
            another strategy in that situation because it worked and it made a
            positive outcome.
