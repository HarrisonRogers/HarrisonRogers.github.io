          <h1>
            <strong>Analogy of JS and its relationship to HTML and CSS</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Think of a website like a house: HTML is the structure, CSS is the
            interior design, and JavaScript is the electrics. The HTML creates a
            light switch and CSS makes it look appealing but then JavaScript
            makes it interactive and function. Each language plays a crucial
            role in creating a complete and engaging user experience.
          </p>
          <h1><strong>Control Flow</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Control flow in JavaScript is done using if-else statements, which
            guide the program's execution based on conditions. For Example...
          </p>
          <img src="/imgs/js-dom/if else.png" alt="if-else img" />
          <p>
            What this code is executing is if the hasIngredients = true then the
            <strong>if</strong> code will output
            <br />
            'Gather ingredients'
            <br />
            'Spread mayonnaise on bread'
            <br />
            etc...
            <br />
            Where if the variable hasIngredients = false the
            <strong>else</strong> statement would run
            <br />
            'Go buy ingredients first!'
          </p>

          <!-- Loops -->
          <h1><strong>Loops</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Loops in JavaScript, such as for or while loops, enable repetitive
            execution of a block of code.
            <br />
            <small>We will use a for loop as an example...</small>
          </p>
          <img src="/imgs/js-dom/for.png" alt="for loops" />
          <p>
            The variable slicesOfBread = 3 - meaning we have 3 slices of bread.
            <br />
            There are 3 parts inside the brackets of the for loop which are
            separated by a semicolon ; The first part in the bracket is called
            the initialization (let i = 0;) where we tell the computer we want
            to start our for loop at 0 and that 'i' is basically our loop
            control variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of of the bracket is called the condition. This
            condition takes in a number or the length or an array. For this
            example we have 3 slices of bread so we put i < slicesOfBread,
            meaning i < 3 so that the loop will only execute 3 times. if we
            change slicesOfBread = 5 this means the loop will now execute 5
            times which is why variables are important rather than hard coding
            the number in. If we didn't specify how many times we want the for
            loop to run it would infinitely run and most likely crash the
            computer :(
          </p>
          <p>
            The third part of the bracket is called the Iteration Expression.
            This controls how the variable changes after each loop. i++ means to
            increment by one after a loop has completed, for example...
            <img
              src="/imgs/js-dom/for-execution.png"
              alt="Executing for loop"
            />
            the text below the code is the outcome of the code being run. We
            console log "Spread peanut butter on slice " + (i + 1); You can see
            that the code has been run 3 times which is what we specified in the
            condition part of the for loop bracket. But how has the number 1, 2
            and 3 been put beside the text, first iteration of this loop i = 0
            but then after the loop has completed and starts its second loop i =
            1 since we incremented it (i++) by one every loop. Usually we do i +
            1 if we are counting because the index starts from 0 so the first
            loop would be "Spread peanut butter on slice 0" which we don't want.
            We would only increment by just i if we were to do an array since
            the index of an array starts from 0.
          </p>

          <!-- What is DOM -->
          <h1><strong>What is the DOM?</strong></h1>
          <p>
            Imagine the DOM (Document Object Model) as a magical guide for
            computers to understand and interact with a web page. It's like a
            wizard's wand that allows us to change specific parts of a page.
            <img src="/imgs/js-dom/DOM.png" alt="DOM example" />
            <br />
            In this scenario, when you click the button, it triggers the
            changeText spell (JavaScript code) that uses the magic wand (the
            DOM) to find the heading and change its words to "DOM Interaction!"
            The DOM is like a wizard's tool that empowers us to make dynamic
            changes to the webpage, all with a few lines of code!
