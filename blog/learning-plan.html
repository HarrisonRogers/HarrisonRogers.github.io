            <strong>What is my long-term goal or career pathway?</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to have the freedom of being able to work from
            anywhere. With that freedom, I want to move to a zero-tax country
            because who would not want 40% extra pay? I would like to go down a
            career path in crypto or web3 gaming (video games made through the
            blockchain). The benefits of working for these companies allow for a
            lot more money to be made since they offer stock options and coin
            tokens alongside salary pay.
          </p>
          <h1>
            <strong
              >A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to
              learning
            </strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            My strengths are that I am good at not procrastinating. I like to
            consistently do a task given to me throughout the week rather than
            draining myself for only two days to get something done. Another
            strength of mine for learning especially in the Dev Academy
            environment (online) is that I have taught myself HTML and CSS to an
            advanced level by watching videos and practicing so I know what
            learning method works best for me, that being practical learning by
            actually writing the code as I follow along with a video.
          </p>
          <p>
            A limitation I have when it comes to learning is that my mind can
            think about things I am looking forward to after I finish a task
            which then makes me unfocused so I have to track back a few minutes
            in a tutorial since I wasn’t focusing and didn’t comprehend what the
            section was about.
          </p>
          <h1>
            <strong
              >What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see
              developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</strong
            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            I would like to be more assertive in my ideas. Whenever I believe to
            have a good idea I tend to get scared that others will think it is a
            bad idea and won’t work. I think I can generally improve a project
            like in school or a leadership situation but I tend to back away
            since I'm afraid to speak up.
          </p>
          <h1>
            <strong
              >A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this
              program.</strong
            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am managing my workload by giving myself a period where I learn on
            this course every day, 9am-5pm. I don’t have any commitments besides
            keeping myself fit with Muay Thai, so I have plenty of time to work
            throughout this program.
          </p>
          <p>
            A way I will work with other learners and facilitators will be
            through communication through the discord by either chat or video
            call. I have already asked my home group some questions and the
            other students and facilitator have helped me in answering these
            questions. They have also provided feedback on some work that I sent
            in which helped me in making my blog website better.
          </p>
          <p>
            When times are getting tough it is easiest for me to just take a
            break to let my mind think about the problem in a different
            environment than being in front of a screen. I might go to the gym
            or spend some time outside on a walk or run to give myself a reboot
            before I get back into the heavy workload.
          </p>
          <h1>
            <strong
              >A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely
              way</strong
            >
          </h1>
          <p>
            I will use the discord chat as a way to seek help or chat GPT. Chat
            GPT is a quick way for an easy solution to code and any technical
            questions I may have. The discord I will use for more course-related
            questions may be about the technical side of what the course is
            instructing me to do and for help about the course since the
            facilitators and even some students will have to answer for me.
          </p>
          <h1><strong>Schedule:</strong></h1>
          <p>
            A commitment I am making time around is Muay Thai. I love the sport,
            it keeps me fit, and strong and helps with my anxiety and stress. I
            tend to have Muay Thai sessions most days throughout the week but it
            starts at a reasonable time of 5:30 pm or 6:30 pm so I have most of
            the day to work on the course content.
