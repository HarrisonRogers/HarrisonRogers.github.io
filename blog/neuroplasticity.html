          <h2><strong>What is Neuroplasticity?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            "Neuroplasticity or brain plasticity is defined as the ability of
            the nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic
            or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or
            connections."

          <h2>
            <strong>How I am going to use Neuroplasticity to my benefit</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            I will go into any new learning with an open mindset and have the
            will to learn and change anything that could impair me from learning
            about a topic, e.g. being on the phone, having my mind drift off
            etcâ€¦
          </p>
          <h2>
            <strong
              >What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity?</strong
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            To increase my neuroplasticity I will keep exercising daily for at
            least an hour a day to increase blood flow to the brain which helps
            with growth in the brain. Another I am going to increase my
            neuroplasticity is with adequate sleep, 8+ hours. This allows me to
            optimize brain health. I will also stray social with my friends and
            family which stimulates the brain and helps with emotional support.
            Lastly is to continuously learn and gain knowledge on different
            things. This requires mental effort and stimulates different parts
            of the brain.
          </p>
          <h1><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></h1>
          <h2><strong>What is having a Growth Mindset</strong></h2>
          <p>
            A growth mindset is a belief system or attitude that individuals
            hold regarding their abilities and intelligence. Those with a growth
            mindset believe that their skills, talents, and intelligence can be
            developed and improved over time through dedication, effort, and
            persistence. They view challenges, setbacks, and failures as
            opportunities for learning and growth rather than as indicators of
            fixed limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, individuals with a fixed mindset believe that their
            abilities and intelligence are innate traits that cannot be
            significantly changed. They may avoid challenges for fear of
            failure, give up easily when faced with obstacles, and view
            criticism as a reflection of their inherent abilities rather than as
            constructive feedback.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>My experience having a Growth Mindset</strong></h2>
          <p>
            I have applied a growth mindset to my life since learning about it
            in primary school. My experience using a growth mindset has been
            extremely important to me in approaching different learning
            experiences and being able to enjoy the little things in life and
            find the positive in most things. This has allowed me to be stress
            free and be very happy, because in the end of the day everyone wants
            to be happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning with a growth mindset has been super beneficial to me. It
            has allowed me to approach new learning content with a positive mind
            and give it a go no matter how hard it is. In Dev Academy I have
            learnt many things already within these 3 weeks and I have loved all
            of it, no matter if I found something difficult, the end result with
            new knowledge makes me happy and rewarding.
