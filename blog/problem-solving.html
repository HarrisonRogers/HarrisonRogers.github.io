              Throughout sprint 4 when was I blocked on a problem and how did I
              solve it?

          <h1><strong>When I was stuck on a problem</strong></h1>
          <p>
            A simple problem I faced was during the whereAreYou.js challenge
            where I was stuck trying to output “Scooby” on the computer. I had
            to go through an array of objects to find out which object Scooby
            was hiding in. I had the code right but I forgot one simple step of
            returning the function.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help me solve this problem though I took a break from coding to
            let myself re-gather and take my mind off of the challenge, I also
            asked questions in the tech questions which helped narrow down that
            it was something to do with the return method. These methods helped
            me out a lot because when faced with this challenge I was getting
            frustrated and angry that it didn’t work, but these strategies made
            me take my mind off of the challenge and re-gather my thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learnt a valuable lesson about reaching out for help no matter the
            difficulty of the challenge because in the end, I am paying for this
            course so the facilitators should help me out. I also learned about
            the placement of the return statement when dealing with functions.
          </p>

              <i>Pseudocode:</i> Very confident - used comments a lot throughout
              porjects I have done.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Trying something: </i> Ok - Never hurts to just give something
              a go.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Rubber ducky method:</i> Not confident - I have not tried this
              but at some stage I likely will.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Reading error messages:</i> Confident - I have read some error
              messages and understood what they meant but I also have not
              understood what some meant
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Console.logging:</i> Very Confident - Used console.log() all
              the time so I know how to use it to help me.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Googling:</i> Very Confident - Been googling all my life
              through school and jus to find out answers to something I am
              intrigued about.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Asking your peers for help:</i> Confident - I keep to myself a
              little bit but I'm not afraid to ask for help.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Asking coaches for help:</i> Confident - Again like the one
              above I keep to myself but I have been asking questions the in
              tech questions chat
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Improving your process with reflection:</i> Not Confident - I
              am getting better at this throughout these weeks at Dev Academy
              but I don't ever reflect with reflections so this is new to me.

          <h1>
            <strong>Why I was reluctant to ask for help at one point</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Like I stated before I like to keep to myself so asking for help
            isn't my biggest strengths, I would rather just do it many times
            until something just works.
